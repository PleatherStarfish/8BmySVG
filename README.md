# p5js_8bit_svgs
This is little JavaScript library to render SVG graphics in the style of 8-bit graphics in a P5.js canvas. This library originated in a collaboration with [@marcusfgardiner](https://github.com/marcusfgardiner) for his [mood_mini_me](https://github.com/marcusfgardiner/mood_mini_me) app.
